The GT Graphics Library is a Python tool 
designed to generate XML structures 
for use with vMix titles (gtzip files). 
It simplifies the creation of complex layouts 
by providing an object-oriented approach 
to define layers, shapes, text blocks, and animations.

## Features

- Object-oriented interface for creating vMix title compositions.
- Support for layers, rectangles, text blocks, and more.
- Animation support for dynamic title sequences.
- Export functionality to generate XML files compatible with vMix titles.

## Installation

To install the GT Graphics Library, you'll need Python 
installed on your system. The library is structured 
as a standard Python package, so installation is straightforward.
Simply clone the repository or download the package 
and include it in your project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gt-graphics-library.git
cd gt-graphics-library
```

Alternatively, if the package is available on PyPI, you can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install gt-graphics-library
```

Usage
Here is a basic example of how to use the GT Graphics Library 
to create a composition with a layer, rectangle, and text block:
```python
from gt_graphics import objects, storyboard

# Initialize the root of the composition with the desired width and height
root = objects.Root(1920, 1080)

# Create a layer
layer1 = objects.Layer("Layer 1", 0, 0, 1920, 1080)

# Create a rectangle and add it to the layer
rect1 = objects.Rectangle("Rect 1", 10, 10, 100, 100)
rect1.set_fill("#FF0000")
layer1.children.append(rect1)

# Create a text block and add it to the layer
text1 = objects.TextBlock("Text 1", 50, 50, 300, 100, "Sample Text")
layer1.children.append(text1)

# Add the layer to the root composition
root.layers.append(layer1)

# Create a storyboard for animations
sb = storyboard.Storyboard()
reveal_animation = storyboard.RevealAnimation(rect1, direction="Right")
sb.append(reveal_animation)
root.storyboards.append(sb)

# Generate the XML file
root.to_xml()
```

This code snippet will create a vMix title composition 
with a red rectangle and text block that appears with a reveal animation.
